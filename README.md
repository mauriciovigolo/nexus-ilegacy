# About
The purpose of this cli tool is to import maven, npm or nuget artifacts to the Nexus OSS. It all began when we started to migrate from the Artifactory repo to the Nexus OSS at work. At that moment I didn't find a tool or functionality at Nexus to get the job done. So to avoid repetitive work I decided to write a simple cli that calls mvn, npm and nuget behind, taking a directory as starting point to recursively search for artifacts to deploy to the Nexus OSS 3x.

This first beta release works with maven, however soon the npm and nuget will also be available.
